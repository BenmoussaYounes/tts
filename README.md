# <div align="center">📃 Text And Speech 🔉</div>

## 🚀 Getting Started ( PROJECT STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT 🚧 )
- **Text And Speech** is a full-stack application consisting of a mobile app developed with Flutter and a server app using FastAPI.
  The mobile app allows you to convert any given text input into speech by sending a request to the server through a REST API.
  The server app processes the text using an AI model to generate the corresponding speech and returns the audio output.
  The application also integrates with a PostgreSQL database for efficient data management. Discover more features and functionalities within the app! 🪄
