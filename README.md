## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Text And Speech** is a full-stack application consisting of a mobile app developed with Flutter and a server app using FastAPI.
The mobile app allows you to convert any given text input into speech by sending a request to the server through a REST API.
The server app processes the text using an AI model to generate the corresponding speech and returns the audio output.
The application also integrates with a PostgreSQL database for efficient data management. Discover more features and functionalities within the app! 🪄
